# SDSC HPC USER Training:  Spring 2020
## WEEK 5: 02/07/2020

## TOPIC: Intro to Parallel Computing: Message Passing Interface (MPI) 
**PRESENTED BY:**  [Mahi Tatineni, SDSC](https://hpc-students.sdsc.edu/instr_bios/mahidhar_tatineni.html) (mahidhar at sdsc.edu)

## READING AND PRESENTATIONS:

* Presentation:  [intro_to_mpi.pdf](./intro_to_mpi.pdf)
* Source code and Instructions:
    - Tarfile: [hpc.mpi.tar](hpc.mpi.tar)
    - Source: [hpc.mpi](hpc.mpi)



## WEEK 5 TASKS:

### TASK 1: download code into your Comet acount

### TASK 2:  Compiling MPI Code
Note: These are the same projects that you were asked to do for the OpenMP topic.

1. Compile and execute the 'hello-mpi.c and hello-cpuid.c' examples source codes on your laptop. (if MPI runs on your laptop)
2. Compile and execute the 'hello-mpi.c and hello-cpuid.c' example source codes on your laptop (if MPI runs on your laptop)
3. Compile and execute the 'hello-mpi.c and hello-cpuid.c' example source codes on Comet and run it as a batch job. 


### TASK 3:  Executing Hybrid Codes 
*  NOTE: TO BE UPDATED for 2020 class: 
* Write a small program to perform a matrix-vector operation and then parallelize the code with OpenMP. Solve the exercise invloving the Hilbert matrix described at the end of the presentation slides.

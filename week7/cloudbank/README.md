## TOPIC: Using the CloudBank Services
**Presented By:** [Rob Fatland](https://escience.washington.edu/people/rob-fatland/)


CloudBank (https://www.cloudbank.org/) provides information, education, training, and allocations for public clouds 
-- initially, AWS, Google, and Azure. Information, education, and training resources are available to anyone in 
the research community. 
Allocation of cloud resources is provided to projects that belong to NSF programs that specify the use of CloudBank 
in the NSF solicitations.  Projects that receive their cloud allocations via CloudBank will also receive 
additional services, as described below. 

In this tutorial, we will learn to use the CloudBank services to track jobs being run on AWS services.

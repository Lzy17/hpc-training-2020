### REPORTING YOUR WORK:
We will track your work using automated scripts, so you need to name the directories exactly as described below:

1. Create a directory under your Comet home account, and call it "hpct20" (for HPC Training)
2. Create a subdirectory called "week1"
* This should result in a directory called 
*	/home/#username/hpct20/week1
